Chapter \@ref(intro)

To properly examine the message of the Cross of Christ in any context, it behoves us to examine Paul's words to the Church at Corinth:

> "For the preaching^[Gk. ${λόγος}$/lógos; "word, statement, message"] of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God." - I Corinthians 1:18

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g. you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
